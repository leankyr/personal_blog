So since I was a kid I have a close friend who loves backgammon. 
Every summer we were meeting in my hometown and played. However, 
during the winters we were in different cities so we could not meet 
to play instead we were using services like dod games. The problem was that dod 
enforces strict time limits and is kind of annoying because we cannot 
even take a break and we have to limit our play time. 

So one day I said enough is enough we have to fix this issue. I took half of
the GD50 course on edx I got the hang of the basics and I started building
our own web backgammon! I added a photo of a board some pawns some logic and 
after messing (a lot) around with networking we were good to go!

Here is the code to the [Backgammon project](https://github.com/leankyr/backgammonLove2D)
