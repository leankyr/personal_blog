My name is George Leandros Kyriazis and I come from Greece. I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle 
University of Thessaloniki where I mainly focused on Computer Science and Robotics. Now I am mainly interested
in algorithms, web development and Cloud Computing. In my free time I play tennis or guitar.
